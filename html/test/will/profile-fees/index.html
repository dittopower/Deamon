			<h2>Profile</h2>
			<p>
			<b>Wilfred Strating Design</b> was established in 1988 and provides personalized, professional design and drafting service to the Brisbane Southside Area.
			<br><br>Wilfred Strating is a qualified Architectural Draftsman having obtained a Certificate for Architectural Technician from Q.I.T in 1978.
			Prior to becoming self employed, Wilfred worked for number of different Architectural Practises and Drafting Offices throughout Brisbane.
			<br><br>Our Fees are very reasonable for professionally drawn plans in CAD (Computer Assisted Drawings) using a 3D CAD application.
			We can also organize Soil Test and Engineering Design through our consulting Engineers.
			<br><br>The advantage of dealing with Wilfred Strating Design, is that all the work is done personally. We do not have employees or outsource any of the work, which means we keep control of the quality and standard of the work.
			I have been a proud member of the HIA since 1995.
