This is the default text document for my INB344 Search Engine Technology Project One.

It is quite basic, it runs in php and was tested using Google chrome.
This task includes:
 ~ A Porter Stemmer implementation, courtesy of Martin on http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/
 ~ A fairly basic custom English or French Language detector and French Stemmer Algorithm.
 ~ A BRILL Tagger (POS Tagger), from Ian Barber on http://phpir.com/part-of-speech-tagging/
 ~ Lexicon for the POS Tagger from Mark Watson on http://markwatson.com/  https://github.com/mark-watson/fasttag_v2
 ~ Information Extraction via Custom Regular Expressions based on the POS tags.
 ~ Wordnet Synonyms and Hypernyms via the SQL Wordnet from http://www.androidtech.com/html/wordnet-mysql-20.php
 
 So input your target document's url and choose the functions you'd like to run.
 
 
 
 ===  The markup notation  ===

Inspired by ''Wikipedia'' our markup notation surrounds text with two
equals signs to denote a major heading and three equals signs for a
subheading.  Whitespace is not significant to our markup notation, so
in this file the three headings have all been laid out differently in
the markup source, but they should still be displayed correctly in the
corresponding HTML version.

===
A note about paragraphs
===

In this test we have not yet started to use HTML '''p''' tags to mark
the beginning and end of paragraphs.  In general it is wise to always
mark paragraphs in this way, although some HTML browsers will display
isolated blocks of text such as this one as a distinct paragraph
anyway.
